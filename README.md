# Perle-Labs-

Most users will find it difficult to complete the task on @PerleLabs 

Here Is why ?

I just realised that it's not just about onboarding but participating 

When everyone can't participate, it becomes a problem.

I also think Perlelabs should work on Optimising their website so that both mobile and pc operators can participate.

You may not see anyone saying anything right now but this is what I personally observed and had to put it out there. 

Perlelabs should please take note of this feedback and make adequate changes and optimisation.
